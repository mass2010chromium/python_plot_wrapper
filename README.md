# python_plot_wrapper

Provide wrapped versions of different visualization packages that run in separate processes using `rpyc` and `multiprocessing`.
Created because I got too annoyed at things not playing well with opengl >:(

## Setup
- `pip3 install build`
- `python3 -m build`
- `pip install dist/plot_wrapper-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl`
